Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. 
A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
